          solar energy. We get 300 days of sunshine. we 
          have a seasonal peak in the summer. These are 
          also times when solar energy is at its peak. 
          Investing in rooftop solar is one of the safest 
          investment as it promises attractive paybacks </p>

        <p>Governments offered incentives in order to encourage

          climate change. </p>
